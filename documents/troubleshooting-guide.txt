Acme Widget Corporation — Troubleshooting Guide

WidgetPro 3000 Won't Turn On
1. Ensure the device has been charged for at least 30 minutes using the included
   USB-C cable and a 20W or higher power adapter.
2. Press and hold the power button for 10 seconds to perform a hard reset.
3. If the LED indicator does not light up after the hard reset, try a different
   USB-C cable. Third-party cables shorter than 1 meter sometimes fail to deliver
   sufficient power.
4. If none of the above works, the battery may be defective. Contact support at
   support.acme.example and reference error code WP3K-BOOT-001.

WidgetPro 3000 Disconnects from Acme Connect App
1. Verify that your phone is running iOS 16+ or Android 13+. Older OS versions
   are not supported by Acme Connect 4.2.
2. Ensure Bluetooth is enabled and the WidgetPro is within 10 meters of your phone.
3. In the Acme Connect app, go to Settings > Devices > Forget Device, then re-pair.
4. If the issue persists, factory reset the WidgetPro by holding the power button
   and the volume-down button simultaneously for 15 seconds. The LED will flash
   red three times to confirm the reset.
5. After factory reset, update the firmware via Acme Connect > Settings > Firmware
   Update. Version 2.4.1 or later resolves known Bluetooth stability issues.

WidgetLite Battery Drains Quickly
1. Check if the WidgetLite firmware is up to date. Firmware 1.3.0 fixed a bug that
   caused excessive battery drain in Bluetooth scanning mode.
2. Disable "Always Discoverable" mode: press the Bluetooth button twice quickly.
   The LED will change from blinking blue to solid blue, confirming discoverable
   mode is off.
3. Normal battery life is 18 hours with moderate use. Continuous audio streaming
   reduces battery life to approximately 12 hours. If the battery depletes in
   under 8 hours, it may be defective — contact support with error code WL-BAT-001.

WidgetMax Not Detected by Fleet Management Software
1. Confirm the WidgetMax is running enterprise firmware (version prefix "E-").
   Consumer firmware (version prefix "C-") is not compatible with fleet management.
2. Ensure the WidgetMax is connected to the same network subnet as the fleet
   management server. The discovery protocol uses UDP broadcast on port 5353 and
   does not work across VLANs without mDNS relay configuration.
3. Check that the fleet management server is running version 3.1 or later. Earlier
   versions do not support the WidgetMax hardware revision 2 (shipped after
   September 2024).
4. If the WidgetMax appears in the server but shows "offline," restart the device
   and check the network cable. The WidgetMax uses a proprietary waterproof RJ-45
   connector — standard cables require the Acme WM-ADAPT-01 adapter ($12 USD).
