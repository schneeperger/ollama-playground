Acme Widget Corporation — Employee Handbook (Excerpt)

Remote Work Policy
As of January 2025, all Acme employees are eligible for hybrid work. Engineering
and product teams work from the office Tuesday through Thursday. Monday and Friday
are remote-optional. Fully remote arrangements require VP-level approval and are
limited to employees with at least 18 months of tenure.

Remote workers must be available on Slack between 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM in their
local time zone. All-hands meetings are held the first Monday of each month at
10:00 AM Pacific Time via Zoom.

Expense Policy
Travel expenses must be pre-approved by the employee's direct manager. Receipts
are required for any expense over $25 USD. Meal reimbursement is capped at $75 per
day for domestic travel and $100 per day for international travel. Alcohol is not
reimbursable. Expense reports must be submitted within 14 days of the trip ending.

Software and tool subscriptions up to $50/month can be purchased without approval.
Anything above $50/month requires manager approval. Annual subscriptions over $500
require finance team sign-off.

PTO Policy
Full-time employees receive 20 days of paid time off per year, accrued monthly.
PTO does not roll over — unused days expire on December 31st. Employees must give
at least 2 weeks notice for PTO requests of 5 or more consecutive days. PTO of
1-4 days requires 3 business days notice.

Sick leave is separate from PTO: employees receive 10 sick days per year. Sick
leave longer than 3 consecutive days requires a doctor's note. Unused sick days
do roll over, up to a maximum of 30 accumulated days.

Parental Leave
Primary caregivers receive 16 weeks of fully paid parental leave. Secondary
caregivers receive 6 weeks. Parental leave must begin within 12 months of the
child's birth or adoption date. Employees may request a part-time transition
period of up to 4 weeks upon returning from parental leave.
